# Push to talk foot pedal

BOM:
- Momentary switch foot pedal ~4€
- Teensy LC ~12€
- Indicator light ~1€

I really love the idea of push to talk, but I don't see myself using it while
playing a game or typing.

Having a foot pedal instead of a keyboard key to
unmute myself would be much easier I think.
