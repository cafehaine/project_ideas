# Desktop Environment Showcase

**I did it!** [github.com/cafehaine/de_showcase/](https://github.com/cafehaine/de_showcase/)

Set up a virtual machine/virtual machines based on Arch Linux (or nixos?) and
boot them up to the desktop and take a screenshot for each Desktop Environment.

Using Vagrant to automate the process?
