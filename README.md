# Project ideas
Ideas for future projects that I might tackle

If any of those ideas already exist in the open-source world, please let me
know!

1. [Docker infra](docker_infra.md) − A controller daemon for a container based
infrastructure
2. [Universal theme generator](/universal_theme_generator.md) − A way to unify
Linux's desktop UI
3. [Push to talk foot pedal](/ptt_pedal.md) − Push to talk, but hands free
4. [Power Over Ethernet Smart-House](/poe_smarthouse.md) − An opensource home
automation system without wireless.
